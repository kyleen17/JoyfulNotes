          <h2>Kindermusik</h2>
          <p>
            Our Kindermusik program offers joyful, age-appropriate classes for children from birth to 7 years old. Each level is designed to support your child's development through music, movement, and playful learning. Babies explore sound and bonding in our Foundations class, while toddlers and preschoolers grow their confidence, language skills, and creativity through instrument play and group interaction. Older children begin exploring musical symbols and ensemble work, building a strong foundation for future music lessons. We also offer mixed-age classes for siblings and families to enjoy music together.

          <h2>Mini Makers - Art Classes</h2>
          <p>
            Our Mini Makers art classes are all about creative expression and fun! Focused mainly on painting, these classes draw inspiration from folk art and are perfect for little artists and their grownups. Kyleen grew up teaching kids painting classes alongside her mother, a folk art teacher, and brings that same colorful joy into every class.
          </p>
          <p><strong>Cost:</strong> Prices vary depending on materials, starting at $15 per class. Some sessions may include a light meal or snack (like pizza!) for kids. We offer a variety of class types, including toddler & caregiver sessions, big kids workshops, and adult classes coming soon!</p>
