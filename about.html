          <p>
            Hi! I'm Kyleen, the founder of Joyful Notes Academy — a place where music, creativity, and connection come to life. I'm a classically trained pianist and music educator with a passion for helping students of all ages discover their musical voice.
            <br><br>
            I hold an Advanced Diploma in Music Performance from Cambrian College, a Bachelor of Music degree from Laurentian University, and my RCM Grade 10 Piano Certification. I've been teaching since 2012 and have worked with students across Ontario in private studios and community programs. Piano and music theory are my specialties, and I love preparing students for exams as much as I love watching them explore new sounds through improvisation.
            <br><br>
            I'm a published author of a notespeller theory book and am currently releasing a comprehensive self-learning music theory guide designed for adult learners. I also create educational resources for teachers on Etsy and have developed complete theory courses that make learning approachable and fun.
            <br><br>
            When I'm not teaching or composing, you'll likely find me spending time with my two beloved dogs or diving into tech — I'm also a web developer and have worked as a successful field recordist in film. Music is the heart of what I do, but storytelling, curiosity, and connection fuel everything I create.

        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
        <p>
          At Joyful Notes Academy, our mission is to create a nurturing space where music is more than just a lesson — it's a bridge between hearts, a spark for imagination, and a lifelong companion.
          <br><br>
          Through our Kindermusik programs, we help children grow cognitively and emotionally by encouraging bonding between parent and child through joyful musical experiences. We believe music should be a natural and cherished part of childhood — a foundation for confidence, creativity, and connection.
          <br><br>
          Whether it's a baby's first music class or a teen preparing for an exam, our goal is to support every student's journey with warmth, encouragement, and personalized learning. We embrace different ways of thinking and teach music theory in a way that clicks — because we believe everyone can understand and love music with the right approach.
          <br><br>
          Joyful Notes Academy is more than a studio — it's a community. A place where families grow together, students feel inspired, and music is a celebration of who we are. Music can heal, connect, and empower — and we're here to share that magic with every family who walks through our doors.
